This project describes the statistical analysis associated with the Getting Data class project, analyzing data provided from the HCI VAR dataset, providing data associated with a Samsung Galaxy S smart phone collecting pedometer and accelerometer data from a smartphone worn on the waist by a number of participants. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project:

Instructions provided:  You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. <br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. <br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br><br>

The output in step five is stored as a .txt file with the name of "Reilly D GettingData classProject.txt".
