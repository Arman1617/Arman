I am a little confused in these exercises as to why GitHub seems to do all of the work, yet we learned command line interface in 
Git Bash but I don't think we need it.  AVG sensed a threat to my computer when I tried to clone the Spoon_Knife fork to save files
Is there a logical and common reason for this?  After I fork and clone the Spoon_Knife files, I was not able to open any on my 
computer but could on GIT HUB and changed some wording.

Why was R Program/Console loaded.  To me it is just another tool to sit, but how do we know that from your lectures?
Were we supposed to be using it instead of GitHub or GitBash to do coding? 

This confusion I believe can be cleared with a few lines of instruction in Intro to Data Scientist's Toolbox as to the when and 
Where and Best Practice for trying.
